# Connect4-Mips
This is the connect 4 game recreated using MIPS assembly language. The program was created using MARS and therefore only tested in MARS.

# Compile
In order to start the program, download the src folder and ensure that all files within the folder remain in the same directory. Then, open connect4.asm which acts as the main function for the entire program. To compile, you must compile all files from connect4.asm.
Go to Settings > Assemble all files in directory.
This will now compile all the files in the directory so that the main funciton can access all other needed functions.

# Run
After hitting compile and run, the program will start automatically and users are greeted to a ascii art with music. The game of connect 4 is then automatically started against a computer.
Follow the intructions in the output console of MARS and enter a location of choice when prompted with player move. The computer will automatically play a valid move (if possible) and return the board back.
NOTE: THE PLAYER TOKEN IS "X" AND COMPUTER TOKEN IS "O"
